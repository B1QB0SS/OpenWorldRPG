# REBUILD

This is going to be a 2d game where a village is destroyed and the player is tasked with doing whatever it takes 
to rebuild.

#Changes to combat concept
Combat will be a 2d turn based style where you will select the attack or action you want to do.

#Economics
Now a 2d scene where you will be able to move and observe (talk to villagers) about what needs to happen in the village.
